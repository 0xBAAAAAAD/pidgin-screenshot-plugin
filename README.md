# pidgin-screenshot-plugin
The plugin for taking screenshot in the Pidgin Messenger. The original project can be found here: https://code.google.com/archive/p/pidgin-sendscreenshot/

If you want to build this plugin in Linux, you won't be able to do so with the new cURL as they they have depreciated the curl/types.h.

I have included the types.h file in this repo so that the plugin could be built without any error with new cURL too.
